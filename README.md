# realsense_bot
This is a ROS package for Intel realsense D435i with 3-DOF Manipulator robot that can be used for Indoor Mapping and localization of objects in the world frame with an added advantage of the robot's dexterity. The 3-DOF Manipulator is a self-built custom robot where the URDF with the depth sensor is included. The package covers the Rosserial based nodes to control the robot's Joint States and PCL pipelines required for autonomous mapping/Localization/Tracking of the objects in real-time.
